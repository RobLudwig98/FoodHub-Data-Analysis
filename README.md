# FoodHub-Data-Analysis
A data science project analyzing FoodHub's dataset to reveal customer habits, forecast demand, and improve service efficiency using Python and visualization tools.
This repository contains my data analysis project for an advanced data science course, focused on exploring FoodHub's order dataset. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to uncover insights into customer behavior and operational efficiency.

Key Features:
- Multivariate and univariate analysis to identify consumption patterns and operational insights.
- Interactive visualizations that reveal customer preferences, order frequencies, and high-value order segments.
- Predictive models for forecasting order trends and informing supply chain decisions.
- Strategies for customer engagement and delivery performance improvement based on data-driven insights.

Skills Showcased:
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Descriptive and inferential statistics
- Data visualization
- Predictive modeling
- Version control with Git and GitHub

Findings from this project were compiled into a PowerPoint presentation, also available in this repository, demonstrating the application of data analysis to real-world business challenges in the food delivery industry.
